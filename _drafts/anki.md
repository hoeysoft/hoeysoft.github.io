Anki: A memorizing flow

Every single learner may feel frustrated on memorizing.
And, we, programmers, are not exception. We have even more things to memorize than others.

I think the best thing is making the situations to memorize nothing.
It's also a criterion of a good UX. For example, When we edit `README.md` on the github,
They provide the MarkDown syntax cheatsheet.
They didn't make use memorize the MarkDown syntax for editing `README.md` file.
