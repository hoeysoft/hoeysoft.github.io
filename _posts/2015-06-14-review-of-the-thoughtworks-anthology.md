Currently, I'm reading this now.  
As the book's title says, This book is a collection of anthologies.  
I've read the most intriging one first, and I'm gonna summarize it now.  

I will append summaries for other chapters in the future.
  

## Chapter 6: Object Calisthenics

The author provides **9 strict rules**:  

1. Use only one level of indentation per method.
2. Don’t use the else keyword.
3. Wrap all primitives and strings.
4. Use only one dot per line.
5. Don’t abbreviate.
6. Keep all entities small.
7. Don’t use any classes with more than two instance variables.
8. Use first-class collections.
9. Don’t use any getters/setters/properties.

And he says:  

>Try to follow these rules thoroughly,
>within a 1000 line project, for 20 hours
