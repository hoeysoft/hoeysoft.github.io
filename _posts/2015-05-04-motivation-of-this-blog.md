================
As I spent more time with writing programs, I had realized that "know-where" can be more valuable than "know-how". It's almost impossible to memorize all things related to modern applications.

Even I'm a game developer, for example, some moments to produce HTML pages occur sporadically. Every time I had been trying to write HTML pages, I had always already forgotten the syntaxes. And then I had always been foraging the references.

I thought it's time wasting. I determined to write down some notes about things I've done, such as reference URLs, cheat sheets, etc.

The first thing I had been working was [Evernote]. I really enjoyed it. The only weakness of it at that time was the initialization cost. Downloading whole pages at newly installed Evernote app took lots of time. Using Evernote web-app was quite slow.

Around about one year later with Evernote, I wanted to share my Evernote pages with my friend. It was easy to share a single page but not some pages as a whole organized content. I felt it's time to change my memo vault.

At that time, my colleague recommended [DokuWiki]. With succinct syntax, it gave me code writing joy while I was writing notes. Abundant plug-ins could give more power to organize it. Even though I should run a web server myself, it looked perfectly fit into my requirements. It was fast and I can access and edit pages anywhere. I had a spare laptop at that time, I made it my DokuWiki server. It has named [hoeysoft-wiki] and it's still working now.

I have been using it since then. I'm still satisfied with it, but I have just made a new fresh blog site and writing this post here. There are three reasons.

1. Needs for a place to write some blog posts. DokuWiki is not capable of.
2. Design desire. Want to compose my page myself.
3. Just wanna try a new thing.

I've googled for the best framework to write programming blog pages. Many people have recommended [Jekyll] at [GithubPages]. So I picked up them. The elegant thing is just a Git repository automatically transformed into a website.

I had spent little laborious times because I'm not familiar with writing web pages. But as they were not so hard concepts, I've got to be comfortable after flailing with Google about them.

I'm going to write stories about attempts to learn something, such as [Jekyll], [Vim], [Git], [Anki], etc.(I've studied them these days.)

And, I'm not a native speaker. I will use this blog as my English writing practice note. Please notice me if you find abnormal or ambiguous expressions.
